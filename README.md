# Accelerometer iOS App

Tracks accelerometer data of an iPhone.
When the screen is tapped, the app updates the screen to display the accelerometer data at the time it was tapped.

Utilizes [CoreMotion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion) framework to pull data from on-board sensors on the iPhone.
